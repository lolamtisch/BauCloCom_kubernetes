The market for cloud solutions is dominated by American companies in the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Cloud solutions offer great scalability and fast deployment while also having lower running costs (Jansen, 2011). Big companies like Volkswagen and EON are using these services for their business processes (Handelsblatt, 2019).
The 2013 Edward Snowden leak showed, that American companies are tightly connected to government bodies and sharing user data for analysis (Landau, 2013).

With plugins for Microsoft Teams, Gitlab, Slack, Twitter and many more Nextcloud can be adapted to many different needs(Nextcloud 2019).
